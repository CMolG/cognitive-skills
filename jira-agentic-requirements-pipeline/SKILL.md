name: jira-agentic-requirements-pipeline
description: Run a two-phase agentic requirements pipeline connected to Jira (Requirement Discovery and Base Branch Generation). Use when a team wants to analyze Jira tickets, detect business ambiguity, generate structured non-technical business questions, collect business answers from CLI with resumable session state, resolve a functional contract, and prepare a constrained base-branch plan with traceability and guardrails.

# Jira Agentic Requirements Pipeline

Execute this workflow to convert ambiguous Jira tickets into actionable engineering inputs without inventing product decisions.

## Quick start

```bash
export JIRA_BASE_URL="https://example.atlassian.net"
export JIRA_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="<your-jira-api-token>"

CLI=jira-agentic-requirements-pipeline/scripts/jira_pipeline_cli.py

python3 "$CLI" fetch-issue DEMO-1 --output issue.json
python3 "$CLI" discovery --input issue.json --output analysis.json
python3 "$CLI" generate-questions --input analysis.json --output questions.json
python3 "$CLI" collect-input --input questions.json --state-file .jira_requirement_state.json
python3 "$CLI" resolve-contract --questions questions.json --answers .jira_requirement_state.json --output contract.json
python3 "$CLI" base-branch-plan --analysis analysis.json --contract contract.json --output plan.json
```

Output files at each step:

| Step | Produces | Used by next step |
|---|---|---|
| `fetch-issue` | `issue.json` (TicketSnapshot) | `discovery` |
| `discovery` | `analysis.json` (TicketAnalysis) | `generate-questions`, `base-branch-plan` |
| `generate-questions` | `questions.json` (BusinessQuestionSet) | `collect-input`, `resolve-contract` |
| `collect-input` | `.jira_requirement_state.json` (resumable) | `resolve-contract` |
| `resolve-contract` | `contract.json` (FunctionalContract) | `base-branch-plan` |
| `base-branch-plan` | `plan.json` (BaseBranchPlan) | engineer review |

## Mandatory flow (run in order)

1. Fetch Jira issue with `scripts/jira_pipeline_cli.py fetch-issue`.
2. Run requirement discovery with `scripts/jira_pipeline_cli.py discovery`.
3. Generate business questions with `scripts/jira_pipeline_cli.py generate-questions`.
4. Collect business answers in terminal with `scripts/jira_pipeline_cli.py collect-input`.
5. Resolve functional contract with `scripts/jira_pipeline_cli.py resolve-contract`.
6. Build base-branch plan with `scripts/jira_pipeline_cli.py base-branch-plan`.

If required answers are missing, stop in phase 1 and do not plan implementation.

## Decision rules

- Ask only functional/product/operations questions.
- Infer architecture and implementation details from repository patterns.
- Keep required questions small and prioritized (typically 5-10 per ticket).
- The selector reserves a baseline budget (default 4) for universally
  required P0 templates (objective / scope / rules / lifecycle) and a
  signal budget (default 6) for templates whose declared signals match
  the ticket's missing decisions. Tune via `--baseline-budget` and
  `--signal-budget`.
- If inference confidence is low (`< 0.65`), generate questions only and request human review.
- Never auto-merge.

## Jira integration

Set environment variables:

- `JIRA_BASE_URL` (example: `https://company.atlassian.net`, no trailing slash needed)
- `JIRA_EMAIL`
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN`

The CLI uses Jira REST API v3 and pages through the `/comment` endpoint
until every comment is fetched. Cap with `--max-comments` (default
`1000`); a stderr warning fires if the cap clipped the result.

## Three modes: rules, llm-augmented, hybrid

The pipeline keeps a deterministic rule-based core (free, offline,
reproducible) and lets the host model that invokes this skill augment
it. The skill never calls a model itself — the model executing the
skill is the one in your editor (Claude in Cursor, Claude Projects,
ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.). Three modes:

### 1. `rules` (default, no model required)

Run the six commands above. The rule-based inferencers in
`scripts/jira_pipeline_cli.py` produce every artifact deterministically
from keyword and density signals.

### 2. `llm-augmented`

After `discovery` the host model reads `analysis.json` and emits a
refinement patch as JSON. Allowed keys are exactly:

```
businessGoal, functionalEntities, userActions, possibleAffectedFlows,
explicitRequirements, missingBusinessDecisions, detectedCategories,
ambiguityLevel
```

Anything else is rejected. Save the patch (e.g. `suggestions.json`)
and merge it:

```bash
python3 "$CLI" merge-llm-suggestions \
  --analysis analysis.json \
  --suggestions suggestions.json
```

The merger:
- unions list-shaped fields with the rule-based output (so additions
  compound, deterministic core is never overwritten);
- replaces scalar fields and keeps the original under
  `_llmAugmentation.ruleBasedSnapshot.<field>` for provenance;
- records every accepted/rejected key under `_llmAugmentation`.

The output stays usable by `generate-questions` and `base-branch-plan`
without changes — both continue to consume `analysis.json`.

### 3. `hybrid`

Hybrid is just the orchestration: run `discovery` first, hand
`analysis.json` to the host model with the prompt in
[`templates/llm-augmentation-prompt.md`](templates/llm-augmentation-prompt.md),
merge the patch, then continue with the rest of the pipeline. The
deterministic baseline is always present; the model only refines.

## CLI mode without losing session state

For business input in terminal:

- Run `collect-input` with `--state-file`.
- State is persisted after each answer.
- If terminal closes or receives `Ctrl+C`, rerun and continue from the next pending question.
- Use `--non-interactive` to validate required completeness in CI or automation.

## Artifact contracts

Every artifact emitted by the CLI carries a top-level `schemaVersion`
(currently `1.0.0`). See `references/contracts.md` for the full shape and
[`docs/contracts.md`](../docs/contracts.md) for the repo-wide versioning
policy.

## References, examples, and troubleshooting

- Internal contracts: `references/contracts.md`
- Full business question catalog and prioritization: `references/question-catalog.md`
- Worked examples (three end-to-end runs): [`EXAMPLES.md`](EXAMPLES.md)
- Common problems and fixes: [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- Jira/report templates: `templates/`

## Guardrails

- Phase 1 is read-only for code changes.
- Phase 2 can prepare a base branch plan/report but must not merge.
- Keep mandatory traceability: ticket -> questions -> answers -> functional contract -> implementation plan.
